# BCDI_Simulation

The repository, BCDI_Simulation, contains scripts that simulate a Bragg Coherent X-ray Diffraction Imaging (BCDI) experiment based on user inputs. It accompanies the following [publication]().

## Installation

For a complete download, please use GitHub Desktop to pull the repository to your machine. If the .zip file is downloaded, the Reconstruction Examples will be pointer files rather than the actual file. This will prevent the reconstructed shapes from being plotted alongside the calculated shapes in the demonstration. Regardless, the MATLAB scripts will still be perfectly functional.


## Usage

Using MATLAB, make BCDI_Simulation your working folder. Then, open the script, BCDI_Simulation, and run it for a demonstration, or type the following into the Command Window:

```matlab
BCDI_Simulation
```
Feel free to build and customize! For specific usage and capabilities, please refer to the comments in each of the files. At the moment, the geometry is based on beamline 34-ID-C at the Advanced Photon Source. If needed, we can help make a plugin for your specific beamline.
